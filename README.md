# 2018_Robot
This is WIP code for team 3172's FRC python robot. For FIRST POWERUP. Robot name was unofficially Stannis Baratheon before Sega Dreamcast won out the vote and took its place as our bot's title (the vote was rigged: no two ways about it). This code is very very very messy and will be near impossible to maintain (thanks competition stress!). Good luck @me
